## Task Description

The task is to implement Bayesian inference in a simple setting. In particular, the setting is as follows. You are given a set of data points $X={x_1,â€¦,x_n}$ which are sampled i.i.d. from one of the following three distributions: 

* Normal distribution: $p_1(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt(2\pi)\sigma}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x}{\sigma})^2}, &ensp;&ensp;\sigma = \sqrt(2)$
* Laplace distribution: $$
